            <h2>Like Nature <br><span>Be Creative and Innovative!</span></h2>
            <p>Fueling creative thinking can be a difficult endeavor, especially in a work environment. Creativity doesn’t always come naturally, and it’s not uncommon for staff to feel stuck at times, especially when there are approaching deadlines and additional stress factors. Solution ideation 一 another term for coming up with a new idea and solutions 一 and managing creativity can be difficult tasks.

                That’s where innovation management comes in. Using tools designed to help foster creativity and encourage innovative ideas, the best innovation management techniques can help you solve  problems, including those that you’ve been putting off for ages.
                
                A word about creativity and innovation: they may seem like similar concepts, but there is a significant difference between the two due to their focus. Creativity is typically centered around original thought and knowledge, which unleashes potential and is an integral part of idea generation. Innovation, on the other hand, is used to turn the creative idea that you come up with into a viable solution. Hand in hand, they are powerful ways to disrupt and adapt, and to create the next great idea, which is increasingly important in today’s ever-changing world. </p>
